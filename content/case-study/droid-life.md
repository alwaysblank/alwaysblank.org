  content: Droid Life was (and is) one of the larger internet destinations for news
    about the Android ecosystem, which meant a number of challenges--most notably
    a need to preserve all existing content _and_ be able to launch the new site with
    minimal downtown. WordPress's database schema and general...behavior can make
    this difficult, so I put together a system for exporting, modifying, and importing
    content so that we could make the necessary changes.
