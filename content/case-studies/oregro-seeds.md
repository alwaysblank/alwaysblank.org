    This site was created to replace an older, outdated site. The primary function of the site is to inform visitors of the wide range of products OreGro, Inc. offers, as well as provide background on the company itself.

    I wasn't directly involved in the initial design of this site; In my capacity as an in-house developer for Murmur Creative, I was given an already-approved design for implementation. On this project, we split development up into front-end and back-end; I built the underlying structure and customized the back-end while one of my co-workers assembled the CSS and JavaScript for the front-end. The size of the Murmur development team and our tight schedules usually mean this type of collaboration isn't possible, for the stars aligned for this project and it resulted in a much, much shorter turnaround that usual--I'm hoping to use the same or a similar process for additional projects in the future.

    To help the client with organizational tasks, this site includes special repositories for staff members (for the staff directory) and the products in their catalog.

    OreGro sells a large number of varieties of grass seed, which have different uses, planting times, qualities, etc. In short, each product needed to include a significant amount of metadata. I wanted this data to be structured, so that it could be understood on some level by a machine, but also be accessible via a UI that would make sense to a human user. The data storage and UI features of Statamic made this relatively straightforward: Instead of having to determine how to actual store and query data, I just had to consider how I wanted it organized, and how I wanted people to interact with it
