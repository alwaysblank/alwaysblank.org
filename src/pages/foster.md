Foster-Powell is an up-and-coming neighborhood in Portland, Oregon's East Side, but the website for their business association was essentially non-existant.

The Foster Area Business Association is a group of allied businesses in Portland, Oregonâ€™s up-and-coming Foster-Powell neightborhood. Their old web site was essentially non-existent, so they pursed a grant from the city to commission a new one. Marina Martinez Consulting won the contact and hired me to do the design and development.

The budget was limited, so the site was designed to be simple yet usable, both in design and functionality. Since it was likely to be further enhanced as more money became available to the business association, I attempted to structure its content to be as ameniable to change and improvement as possible.
